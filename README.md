Fitna Phone
-----------

**Assalamu'alaikum my brothers & sisters in Islam**
This android application is intended to supplement '10 Minutes Steadfast' application (check my other repo).
It can help us to fight against smart phone addiction in more fine-grained control.
You can block only certain apps to be opened when you actually do nothing with it except killing (wasting) time.
